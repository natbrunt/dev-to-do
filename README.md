1) Keep a streak going
2) basic blog `TNSV`
   - frontend: allow frontend to make TypeScript axios requests to communicate with backend routes
     - ensure subit-article route works
     - ensure all admin pages have the isAuthenticated function on them
   - backend: set up tnvs-blog routes
     - editting a post
     - uploading an image
        - multer is the recommended backend service which will be combined with ExpressJS and Nginx   
   - user-credentials route will come later
   - implement StripeJS for donations
   - look into advertisement APIs
4) basic blog `MERN`
   - same backend but the industry standard JavaScript create-react-app way with manually scripted css / tailwind components
5) All ideas:
   - Vercel-port streamlined for updates
   - ECommerce website with StripeJS implemented
   - Basic Blog TNSV with Ads implemented and Stripe for donations
   - Basic Blog MERN with the same idea as above
   - OpenAI related web app service with the same as above
   - Registration System with either TNSV or MERN, for example healthcare or a payment management system

** TNSV
- TypeScript, NodeJS, Shadcn, v0.dev
