1) Keep a streak going
2) Work on tnsv-blog-blob
3) Get a basic blog going that uploads the html content and the href for the images to Mongodb
   - use TNSV for this
   - review old book-worm-blog for reference
6) LATER: treamline updation of vercel-port
   - it would look something like this
   - git fetch the most recent copy
   - make updates to the available projects to display
   - make sure that that project is hyperlinked
   - have that example application be promoted to production on vercel
